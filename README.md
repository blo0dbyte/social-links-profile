### What I learned

This project served to teach me nothing new except that I am steadily progressing with the speed at which I code. Using these challenges as practice really helps!

### Continued development

I'd like to work on the confidence I have with my code, going intuitively with the first solutions that come to mind rather than meticulously double-checking my ideas on google.
